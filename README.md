I wrote this code to simulate wishing system from game "Genshin Impact"

I wanted to know how many wishes does it take, to pull a 5-star character in average,
but because I don't have thousands of dollars in my pocket, I couldn't do that in the game.

So I decided to write a script in Python simulating this system.

The drop rates are public, so I used them as a base.
I included pity so you're guaranteed to get 4-star every 10 pulls and 5-star every 90 pulls.
Then I added a soft pity system, boosting your 5-star drop rate by a bit,
after reaching 75 pity. It isn't offical, so I made it easy to remove, by changing it's value to 0.

You can do whatever you want with it. So have fun.

Just please remember that it's GPL licensed!
